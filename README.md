# pandas-kaggle-learning
This repository contains my journey of learning Machine Learning, starting with Pandas from Kaggle, including exercises, projects, and insights.

# 📊 Pandas Learning Package

This repository is a **complete pandas learning package** based on the **Kaggle pandas learning course**. It contains structured learning modules, with each module consisting of:

- **Tutorial**: A structured explanation with practical examples.
- **Exercise**: Hands-on coding tasks to reinforce learning.

## 📚 Course Modules

Each module is saved as a separate `.ipynb` file and follows a **consistent format**. The files contain both tutorials and exercises in a well-structured manner.

### 🔹 Included Modules
1️⃣ **[Creating, Reading, and Writing](https://github.com/arifur30/pandas-kaggle-learning/blob/main/exercise-creating-reading-and-writing.ipynb)** – Learn how to read, write, and load data.
2️⃣ **[Indexing, Selecting & Assigning](https://github.com/arifur30/pandas-kaggle-learning/blob/main/exercise-indexing-selecting-assigning.ipynb)** – Access and modify DataFrame data effectively.
3️⃣ **[Summary Functions and Maps](https://github.com/arifur30/pandas-kaggle-learning/blob/main/exercise-summary-functions-and-maps.ipynb)** – Use pandas functions to extract insights.
4️⃣ **[Grouping and Sorting](https://github.com/arifur30/pandas-kaggle-learning/blob/main/exercise-grouping-and-sorting.ipynb)** – Aggregate and organize data efficiently.
5️⃣ **[Data Types and Missing Values](https://github.com/arifur30/pandas-kaggle-learning/blob/main/exercise-data-types-and-missing-values.ipynb)** – Handle different data types and deal with missing data.
6️⃣ **[Renaming and Combining](https://github.com/arifur30/pandas-kaggle-learning/blob/main/exercise-renaming-and-combining.ipynb)** – Work with multiple data sources and manage column names.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each module is stored as an individual Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file in the repository. The structure follows:
```
