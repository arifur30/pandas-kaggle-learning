# pandas-kaggle-learning
This repository contains my journey of learning Machine Learning, starting with Pandas from Kaggle, including exercises, projects, and insights.


# 📊 Pandas Learning Package  

This repository is a **complete pandas learning package** based on the **Kaggle pandas learning course**. It contains structured learning modules, with each module consisting of:  

- **Tutorial**: A structured explanation with practical examples.  
- **Exercise**: Hands-on coding tasks to reinforce learning.  

## 📚 Course Modules  

Each module is saved as a separate `.ipynb` file and follows a **consistent format**. The files contain both tutorials and exercises in a well-structured manner.  

### 🔹 Included Modules  
1️⃣ **[Creating, Reading, and Writing]([file_name link](https://github.com/arifur30/pandas-kaggle-learning/blob/main/exercise-creating-reading-and-writing.ipynb))** – Learn how to read, write, and load data.  
2️⃣ **[Indexing, Selecting & Assigning](file_name link)** – Access and modify DataFrame data effectively.  
3️⃣ **[Summary Functions and Maps](file_name link)** – Use pandas functions to extract insights.  
4️⃣ **[Grouping and Sorting](file_name link)** – Aggregate and organize data efficiently.  
5️⃣ **[Data Types and Missing Values](file_name link)** – Handle different data types and deal with missing data.  
6️⃣ **[Renaming and Combining](file_name link)** – Work with multiple data sources and manage column names.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
Each module is stored as an individual Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file in the repository. The structure follows:
